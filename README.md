  Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes: Continuous Paths

In this repository, a presentation ("cntbasics&brownian.pdf"), codes and explanations are given for continuous-time stochastic processes: such as continuous paths. Currently, following codes are available:

- Continuous time stochastic process: **cntStochastic.m**
- Brownian motion algorithms: **brownianMotion.R**
